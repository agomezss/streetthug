### Concept

A 2D game in which I develop using Unity3d and I want to share with anyone that wishes to learn and master Unity just like me ;)

It's a 2D inspired by GTA in which you can:

* Ride cars
* Punch
* Shoot
* Explore
* Get health kit and bullets
* You got chased If you mess with someone angry
* You got chased by the police if you mess with them
* The cars usually stop if you stand in front of then, so you can ride!

### Technology

It was developed using **Unity3d** with **C# Language** and I did it for learn and improve my Unity skills. I used a lot of things that the engine offers for crafting this game like for example:

* Physics2d Engine
* 2D Collision
* Raycasting for detecting proximity with other objects and avoid contact
* AudioSource and Listener
* Prefabs
* SpriteRenderer
* Transform manipulation
* Rigidbody
* Canvas for GUI
* Time manipulation for Pause System

### Contribute

Fell free to fork and play with the project, I just ask please to not redistribute because this game is property of my Game Company called **SandGames Studio** and this is published on the Google Play Store as well ;)
